The event of the week is the addition of **Angular (alpha)** as a target framework for code generation!

Many of you requested it, it's time for us to extend a bit the scope of Clapy. It's marked as "_alpha_", because it does not yet include properties to customize the generated components.

What else?

* Paid clients can now disable the CodeSandbox (download as zip only) to enforce security.
* We will open the paid plan to everybody very soon, to support the growth of Clapy. More details to come. Thanks for your support that made this possible!
