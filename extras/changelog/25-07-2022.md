Here is what changed this week on Clapy.

### Breaking changes

* To generate the code for a page and stretch to the whole page, you need to check the new option: "**Full width/height**".\
  Previously, it was assumed from the layout of the parent element, but was undesired in some cases.

### New features

* New option: [Full width/height](https://docs.clapy.co/#full-width-height).
* New option: [SCSS (experimental)](https://docs.clapy.co/#scss-instead-of-css-beta). It generates SCSS files instead of CSS. As of now, only the extension changes with this option. Please let us know for more changes!
* New option: [SCSS > BEM conventions](https://docs.clapy.co/#scss-instead-of-css-beta). It indents class names in SCSS files.
* Generate code when a _Component Set_ is selected in Figma. All components in the _Component Set_ are generated as if it was a _Frame_.

### Bug fixes

* The layout of SVG elements have been fixed in specific cases
