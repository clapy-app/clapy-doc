# Online code preview/editor, Github, and more

Once the code is generated, you will see 3 options:

* [Live preview](online-code-preview-editor-github-and-more.md#live-preview)
* [Edit code](online-code-preview-editor-github-and-more.md#edit-code)
* [Generate more code](online-code-preview-editor-github-and-more.md#generate-more-code)

![Click to generate the code of the Hero section](<../.gitbook/assets/Click to generate code with Clapy.gif>)

#### Live preview

Clicking on "Live preview" will open a browser tab where you will be able to see the result of your component in full width.

There, you can test the responsiveness of your element within the browser.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the design is not responsive in Figma, it will unfortunately not be responsive in the code generated by Clapy. For better result, try using Figma's [auto-layout feature](../figma-basics/add-auto-layout-in-frames.md) on your designs.
{% endhint %}

#### Edit code

Clicking on "Edit code" will open a browser tab where you will be able to see the whole code structure of your React project, including:

* The app itself
* The components
* The assets

#### Generate more code

By clicking on this button, you will come back to the previous step (select a frame and generate code).

### Github integration

You will be able to get your code in a target repo via Github in the coming weeks.

Here's a quick demo to show you the flow we are working on:

### Export history and Zip folder

We will soon release a log of all the code generated with Clapy, within the plugin.

This Export History will include:

* The time when the code was generated
* The type of export (Codesandbox or Zip download)
* A link to Codesandbox of the generated code, if this option was selected

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** Clapy does not store the Zip folders generated with the plugin. They won't be available for download in the Export History.
{% endhint %}
